      <p>In The Sims 3, Bella may start as a child, but make no mistake: she is still a fashion icon (see THE red dress). She goes by her maiden name of Bachelor, and she grows up to look different from the adult versions of her from prior games (The Sims & The Sims 2). Sims 3 also has famously <i>unique</i> Sims. It's giving Cubism sometimes.</p>
      <p>She is good, brave, lucky, and slightly gothic, as evidenced by the skulls in her room and playroom. This penchant for the gothic and love of the paranormal my hint at why she ultimately marries Mortimer Goth (if you don't interfere). Bella and Mortimer are best friends when you start the game, and legacy players know where that leads us...</p>

      <p>We first meet Bella Goth; her husband, Mortimer Goth; and her daughter, Cassandra Goth in The Sims. She is an elegant, athletic, woman who seems to enjoy playing golf. If you play her, you will discover her penchant for painting or playing the piano. Most importantly, she <s>wears</s> <i>bodies</i>  that trademark red dress.</p>
      <p>She starts the game unemployed and without skill points, but she does have an extremely good relationship with Mortimer (a mutual 100/100 level). She is also friends with her daughter Cassandra but does not know any other Sims in the neighborhood. An icon.</p>
      <p>Remember her maiden name and family in The Sims 3? Since there are no familial relationships in The Sims, she has no relation to her brother Michael Bachelor, nor does anything in-game even hint that the two are related.</p>

      <p>By Sims 2, Bella has had another child: Alexander Goth. She has also mysteriously disappeared into another neighborhood--aliens. It's aliens. She was abducted. On the bright side, the game does confirm that she is Michael Bachelor's sister, so...</p>
      <p>Weirdly, she does exist in Pleasantview but is hidden within the game code and can only be found using cheats or third-party programs. Bella's disappearance is a major component of Pleasantview's story and it is theorized that Maxis picked her for this major role because she is a mysterious, elegant woman. She was last seen on Don Lothario's deck (tea), whose photo album and memory panel show that Bella rejectd his bald-headed and raggedy romantic interactions just before she mysteriously disappeared.</p>
      <p>Mortimer, Cassandra, and Alexander had many memories of Bella, so she hasn't been gone for too long. On the family tree panel, Bella's face is not grey, intimating that she is not dead. Although her husband and daughter have memories of her being abducted by aliens, the story does not explicitly state what happened to Bella--AAAALIENS.</p>
    <p>Someone who looks a lot like Bella is a Strangetown townie. This version is a little different than the Pleasantview Bella, but Maxis acknowledged her as Bella. She has no memories of her loved ones or past life on account of myriad and sundry experiments during her abduction.</p>

      <p>This Bella is on an alternate timeline. She is stunning, striking, and sensational. She is certainly giving peak Bella visuals, but none of the lore. And yet, if you remember the classic Bella, she has a great relationship with her husband, son, and daughter, but no one else in the neighborhood.</p>
